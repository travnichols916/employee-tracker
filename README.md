## Description
* MySql is a relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server.
